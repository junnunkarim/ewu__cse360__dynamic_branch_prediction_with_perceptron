**Miniprojector Description: CSE360: Computer Architecture**

**Guidelines: **Mini project is to be done by a *group of three students*. The project is to be implemented in any of the programming language: Verilog orC/C++/Java. Each project work carries documentation in the form of a project report to be submitted in printed form \- A4 size with soft binding. The project report structure is:

1. **Title**  
2. **Objective: **(The objective describes the goal of the project work.)  
3. **Theory: **(The theory is formal design comprising descriptions, essential mathematics, formulas, derivations, etc.)  
4. **Design: **(The design part comprises flowcharts, algorithms, tables, diagrams, derivations, etc.)  
5. **Implementation: **(The implementation is description of functional modules of code, hierarchical relationship, coding with built-in documentation, list of system requirements, like compilers, operating system, etc.)  
6. **Debugging-Test-run: **(The Test-run and result part of the report contains detailed method of testing, assuring that the code is fool-proof and fully debugged.)  
7. **Results analysis (if any): **(The Analysis part should discuss other aspects, like complexity of algorithms in terms of average and worst-case complexity for time and space, robustness of the approach used, finer technical details, etc.)  
8. **Conclusion and Future Improvements: **(The conclusion and future aspect should summarize the project in brief, what improvements can be possible, which could not be considered due to time limits, limitations (if any in the design and implementation), various applications of this design, etc.)  
9. **Bibliography: **The bibliography section should provide the detailed list of references of books, journals, websites, conferences, and others in the standard accepted formats.

The report should have a front cover in the standard form, generally used for seminar/dissertation, giving project title, class, name of student, guide, name of Institution, year, and month & year of submission, all in standard acceptable formats.
